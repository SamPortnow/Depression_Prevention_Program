Depression_Prevention_Program
=============================

Android app modeled from the Depression Prevention Course

The components of the app are:

1) Users keep a diary tracking what they did, how they felt, and what they were thinking

2) Users learn to replace negative thoughts with positive ones with the "negative thought destroyer game"

3) Users learn what activities make them feel good, and what activities make them feel bad with a graphical
representation of their daily diary


#TODO 

1) Sound effects. Lightning for "negative thought clouds", explosions for when they are destroyed, bird 
chirping for when the negative thought clouds are destroyed?

2) Decide what consitutes the end of the game. When all of the negative thoughts from the db are destroyed?
When there are only positive thoughts on the screen -- and no more room for negative thoughts? In order to do
this there would have to be a default string array of negative thoughts, and which negative thoughts would 
pop up would random. I am leaning towards this option. 

3) Keep track of points (and develop a scoring system).
