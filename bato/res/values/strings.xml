    <string name="setup">The aim of this app is to help people build the skills that researchers find 
helpful in feeling good. These two skills are:\n \n

1)  Being your own "personal scientist". Know the activities you do that make you feel good (or bad), 
and know the thoughts you think that make you feel good (or bad). \n

2) Replacing negative thoughts with positive ones.\n \n


You will build these skills through a daily diary, daily mood graphs, and the "Negative Thought Destroyer Game". \n\n
