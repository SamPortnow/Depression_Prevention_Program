The aim of this app is to help people build the skills that researchers find 
helpful in feeling good. These two skills are:

1) 
Discover the activities you do that make you feel good and the activities you do that
make you feel bad; discover the thoughts you think that make you feel good and the
things you think that make you feel bad. In short, make 
yourself into your own "personal scientist". 

2) The ability to replace negative thoughts with positive ones. 


You will build these skills through two key parts of this app. The first is a 
daily diary of your mood in which you track what you are doing, 
what you are thinking, and how  you are feeling. 
TAG YOUR THOUGHTS WITH A + FOR POSITIVE THOUGHTS, AND A - 
FOR NEGATIVE THOUGHTS. From your diary, you will see able to see a graph
of your daily mood. Click each point to see how what you were doing and what
you were thinking are related to how you were feeling. It is up to you to 
change your activities to suit YOUR needs. The principle is simple: do LESS of 
what makes you feel bad, and MORE of what makes you feel good. If it is your thoughts
that you believe are making you feel bad, we hope the second part of this
app will address that.

The second part of this app is the "Negative Thought Destroyer Game". 
The thoughts you tagged with a - in your diary will be placed into a "negative thought cloud". 
It is your task to destroy them with a positive thought! Be quick, you will be awarded 
bonus points for faster responses!
